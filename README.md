# Brackeys-Project
 A simple 2D platformer game

Following the tutorial, a basic 2D platformer was created with enemies, moving platforms and coin collection.
Some extra features added:
	Raycast checks so that enemies will not fall off ledges
	A StateMachine to handle the character state and make the code more presentable
	Coyote time for better quality of life with platforming.

The main goal of the project as of now is to brush-up on some Godot basics and also test the exporting and git features.
The project as of now lacks a win condition and acts as a sandbox to test some features.
